This standard requires bike rack parking spaces to be 2' wide x 6' long. The proposal reduces the dimensional standard for width by 6 inches so that 467 of the 473 long term bike parking spaces are accommodated by a wall-hung vertical rack system, which provides parking that is spaced 18\" on center, with a 6\" stagger. (The remaining 6 long term bike spaces will be in horizontal racks that meet the standard.) 33.510.205 H.2. Modification #2. The project seeks additional height above the maximum height limits shown on Map 510-3. The height limit indicated on Map 510-3 is 100' and the proposed height is 252'. (The site is located within the height opportunity area shown on Map 510-16. The floor area above the maximum height limit of 100' is proposed to be achieved through FAR bonus, the floors of the building above 100' are less than 12,500 sf, and facade lengths above 100' are less than 120'.)
